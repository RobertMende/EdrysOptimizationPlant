        # Welcome to the Optimization Plant

        This plant is used to determine the influence of reactor temperature,
        flow rate and concentration on the oxidation of methanol. 


        To control these parameters, students are able to set the oven
        temperature, the thermostat temperature of the saturator and the flow
        rate of the incoming air.


        In order to evaluate the extent of influence of these factors, the
        exhaust air is split and partially flows through an infrared
        spectrometer. 


        The IR spectrum itself as well as the time-resolved transmission at
        characteristic wavelengths give semi-quantitative insights into the
        product distribution.
